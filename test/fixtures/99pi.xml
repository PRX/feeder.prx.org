  <itunes:summary>Design is everywhere in our lives, perhaps most importantly in the places where we've just stopped noticing. 99% Invisible (99 Percent Invisible) is a weekly exploration of the process and power of design and architecture. From award winning producer Roman Mars, KALW in San Francisco, and Radiotopia from PRX. Learn more: http://99percentinvisible.org

Awesome people saying nice things:
"Roman Mars lights the radio.  His pieces conjure other worlds, grapple with big ideas, make sound three dimensional.  They are smart and funny and original. The Kitchen Sisters would like to be Presidents of his Fan Club." -The Kitchen Sisters, NPR

"Highly digging 99% Invisible. One of the best podcasts I've bumped into in a while." -Jad Abumrad, Radiolab

"I love the show. It's wonderful. Actually reminded me of why I love radio." -Jonathan Goldstein, CBC's WireTap

"99% Invisible is completely wonderful…entertaining, and beautifully produced.” -Ira Glass, This American Life

<p>The sounds that came out Frank Conrad&#8217;s Garage in 1919 and 1920 are gone. There were no recordings made, and everyone who participated in his audio experiments have died. In this piece, Radio Diaries uncovers what might have happened in Frank Conrad’s garage, where some people say modern broadcasting began.</p>
<p>The first portable audio recorder was made in 1945 by a man named Tony Schwartz. He moved the VU meter from inside of the unit to the top, so he could see the recording volume. And, he put a strap on it so that he could hang the device over his shoulder. Armed with his recorder (and sometimes a secret microphone attached to his wrist), Schwartz chronicled every sound in his Manhattan neighborhood. He recorded children singing songs in the park, street festival music, jukeboxes in restaurants, vendors peddling vegetables, and more than 700 conversations with cab drivers, just to name a few examples. The Kitchen Sisters have his story.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to legend, Sarah Winchester&#8217;s friends advised the grieving widow to seek the services of a Boston spiritual medium named Adam Koombs. The story goes, Koombs put Mrs. Winchester in touch with her deceased husband—but William had bad news.</p>
<p>He told Sarah Winchester that she would always be haunted by the spirits who had been killed by Winchester rifles.</p>
<p>Speaking through Koombs, William Winchester instructed Sarah to placate the spirits by building a structure that would perpetually grow to shelter the ever-increasing number of Winchester rifle victims.</p>
<p>And if she did this, Sarah Winchester would gain immortality.</p>
<p>But the real story might have a lot fewer ghosts, but is way more inspiring. Ninna Gaensler-Debs gives us a tour of the <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mystery-house/" target="_blank">Mystery House</a></p>

    <itunes:summary>According to legend, Sarah Winchester's friends advised the grieving widow to seek the services of a Boston spiritual medium named Adam Koombs. The story goes, Koombs put Mrs. Winchester in touch with her deceased husband—but William had bad news.

He told Sarah Winchester that she would always be haunted by the spirits who had been killed by Winchester rifles.

Speaking through Koombs, William Winchester instructed Sarah to placate the spirits by building a structure that would perpetually grow to shelter the ever-increasing number of Winchester rifle victims.

And if she did this, Sarah Winchester would gain immortality.

But the real story might have a lot fewer ghosts, but is way more inspiring. Ninna Gaensler-Debs gives us a tour of the Mystery House</itunes:summary>

<p>To understand why someone would want to steal a palm tree, we need to understand their value—which has a lot to do with the space they occupy in our collective imagination. We don’t plant palms for any of the normal reasons we want other trees around. They produce little shade, are difficult to climb, and don’t, for the most part, produce edible fruit.</p>
<p>Palm trees, it seems, do something else.  They’re evocative. They’re transportative. They inspire us to dream big.</p>

The game is not as ancient as it was designed to look, but those two arched rows of letters have been spooking people for over 125 years.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 13th, 1977, lightning struck an electricity transmission line in New York City, causing the line&#8217;s automatic circuit breaker to kick in. The electricity from the affected line was diverted to another line. This was fairly normal and everything was fine—until a second bolt of lightening struck.<br />
Electric lines started shutting themselves off. As more and more lines were shut off, the system started to shut itself down. Eventually, the largest power generator in the area, known as Big Allis, turned itself off.<br />
And then all of New York City went dark.<br />
On that evening, DJ Grandmaster Caz, a Bronx native, was spinning records in a park. Caz recalls the evening: &#8220;The record just started slowing down, you know what I mean? So, quite naturally, we thought, it was us. We thought we had drained too much power and we shorted out the electricity. So we&#8217;re frantic, we&#8217;re looking around, we&#8217;re checking buttons, were checking switches, we&#8217;re seeing what&#8217;s up.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It was chaos that night,&#8221; says Grandmaster Caz. &#8220;And it was exciting afterwards. But while it was going on, it was scary.&#8221;<br />
But Caz also believes that the the 1977 blackout may have accelerated the burgeoning Hip Hop movement. His theory: the looting that occurred during the blackout enabled people who couldn&#8217;t afford turntables and mixers to become DJs.</p>

Electric lines started shutting themselves off. As more and more lines were shut off, the system started to shut itself down. Eventually, the largest power generator in the area, known as Big Allis, turned itself off.
And then all of New York City went dark.
On that evening, DJ Grandmaster Caz, a Bronx native, was spinning records in a park. Caz recalls the evening: "The record just started slowing down, you know what I mean? So, quite naturally, we thought, it was us. We thought we had drained too much power and we shorted out the electricity. So we're frantic, we're looking around, we're checking buttons, were checking switches, we're seeing what's up."
"It was chaos that night," says Grandmaster Caz. "And it was exciting afterwards. But while it was going on, it was scary."
But Caz also believes that the the 1977 blackout may have accelerated the burgeoning Hip Hop movement. His theory: the looting that occurred during the blackout enabled people who couldn't afford turntables and mixers to become DJs.

Straight lines might be logical, predictable, and efficient, but they are also completely &#8220;godless&#8221;—at least according to Austrian artist and designer Tausendsassa Friedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser (which translates to &#8220;Multi-Talented Peace-Filled Rainy Day Dark-Colored Hundred Waters” in German).<br />
Hundertwasser made a name for himself, so to speak, with his psychedelic, whimsical paintings and his public speaking engagements that he would sometimes deliver completely naked.<br />
As a proponent of radical human expression, Hundertwasser sought to create structures that were free from straight lines, which he saw as constricting and devoid of organic elements.</p>

There are plenty of images like this from this era— scenes of people standing around proudly as they shaped the earth. And in these old photos there seems to be a real sense of awe and reverence for the marvels of civil engineering.<br />
The above photo is a scene from the reversal of the Chicago River (see episode episode <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tags/86">#86</a>, true believers!). The reason that photo is famous—or at least famous enough for us to have seen it—is because the reversal of the Chicago River was an enormous engineering project that was successful.<br />
But you have to figure that there were countless other photographs depicting similarly-awe-inspiring feats of engineering prowess that we have never seen— because those feats turned out to be failures.<br />

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cities, like living things, evolve slowly over time. Buildings and structures get added and renovated and removed, and in this process, bits and pieces that get left behind. Vestiges. Just as humans have tailbones and whales have pelvic bones, cities have doors that open into a limb-breaking drop, segments of fences that anyone can walk around, and pipes that carry nothing at all.<br />
Most of the time, these architectural leftovers rust or crumble or get taken down. But other times, these vestiges aren’t removed. They remain in the urban organism. And sometimes—even though they no longer serve any discernible purpose—they’re actually maintained. They get cleaned and polished and re-painted just because they’re there.<br />
These urban vestiges first caught the attention of an artist in Japan named Akasegawa Genpei. One day, in 1972, he was walking to lunch, and he came across a staircase that went up and then back down but had no door at the top. Then Akasegawa noticed that a piece of the railing that had been recently fixed. That&#8217;s when something clicked.<br />
Akasegawa started noticing similar urban leftovers, and treasured them as artistic byproducts of the city. He photographed all the things he could find that were both vestigial and maintained. He began publishing his findings in a magazine column, accompanied by musings about each object.<br />
People began to send Akasegawa pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found, and in his column, Akasegawa would judge all submissions on two criteria:<br />
1. Were they truly, completely useless?<br />
2. Were they regularly maintained?<br />

    <itunes:summary>Cities, like living things, evolve slowly over time. Buildings and structures get added and renovated and removed, and in this process, bits and pieces that get left behind. Vestiges. Just as humans have tailbones and whales have pelvic bones, cities have doors that open into a limb-breaking drop, segments of fences that anyone can walk around, and pipes that carry nothing at all.
Most of the time, these architectural leftovers rust or crumble or get taken down. But other times, these vestiges aren’t removed. They remain in the urban organism. And sometimes—even though they no longer serve any discernible purpose—they’re actually maintained. They get cleaned and polished and re-painted just because they’re there.
These urban vestiges first caught the attention of an artist in Japan named Akasegawa Genpei. One day, in 1972, he was walking to lunch, and he came across a staircase that went up and then back down but had no door at the top. Then Akasegawa noticed that a piece of the railing that had been recently fixed. That's when something clicked.
Akasegawa started noticing similar urban leftovers, and treasured them as artistic byproducts of the city. He photographed all the things he could find that were both vestigial and maintained. He began publishing his findings in a magazine column, accompanied by musings about each object.
People began to send Akasegawa pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found, and in his column, Akasegawa would judge all submissions on two criteria:
1. Were they truly, completely useless?
2. Were they regularly maintained?
In 1985 Akasegawa published a book of these collected photographs and writings, in which he coined a term for these kinds of urban leftovers. He called them, “Thomassons.”</itunes:summary>

<p style="color: #363636;">“Egress” refers to an entire exit system from a building: stairs, corridors, and evacuation routes outside the building. Each state’s building code specifies a certain number of means of egress, depending on the size and purpose of the structure.</p>
<p style="color: #363636;">Simply put, there have to be enough doors, corridors, and stairs for every occupant to exit in an orderly manner in the event of an emergency.</p>

“Egress” refers to an entire exit system from a building: stairs, corridors, and evacuation routes outside the building. Each state’s building code specifies a certain number of means of egress, depending on the size and purpose of the structure.
Simply put, there have to be enough doors, corridors, and stairs for every occupant to exit in an orderly manner in the event of an emergency.</itunes:summary>

When the government started to oversee aviation in 1958, the congressional law did not even make hijacking a crime and the early design of airport terminals reflected this mentality.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In just about every movie set in New York City in the 1970s and 80s there&#8217;s an establishing shot with a graffiti-covered subway.<br />
For city officials, train graffiti was a sign that they had lost control. So, starting in the early 70s, mayors of New York vowed to eradicate graffiti. First, Mayor John Lindsey formed the first anti-graffiti task force. He also re-classified graffiti from a nuisance, like littering or loitering, into a crime.<br />
In 1984 David Gunn became President of the New York City Transit Authority.<br />
Systemically, train line by train line, Gunn took the subways off the map for graffiti writers. While they were fixing it, they didn’t allow any graffiti on it. If graffiti artists “bombed” a train car, the MTA pulled it from the system. Even during rush hour.<br />
May 12, 1989 was declared the official day of the city&#8217;s victory over train graffiti.<br />
But of course train graffiti has never stopped.<br />
There is still subway graffiti—it just never leaves the train yards. Artists—many of them from abroad—paint subway cars knowing full well that they will get cleaned before they&#8217;re ever seen by the public.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The westernmost part of Manhattan, between 34th and 39th street, is pretty industrial. There’s a bus depot, a ferry terminal, and a steady stream of cars. But in the late 19th early 20th centuries, this was cow country.<br />
Cows used to be ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey, herded across Twelfth Avenue (now the West Side Highway), and brought to this part of town to be made into beef.<br />
You’ve heard of the meat packing district. This was like the meat hacking district. It was nicknamed &#8220;Abattoir Place.&#8221; It was a hive of bone boilers and hide stretchers and lard renderers. There was a disassembly line for every single part of a cow.<br />
As more and more cows were ferried to the slaughterhouses in Manhattan, it became impossible for passing herds to to coexist with Twelfth Avenue traffic. Not only did the number of cows increase, but so too had the number of carriages, and trains, and, eventually, cars. Cows were in the way. There were reports of epic cow jams on Twelfth avenue.<br />
That’s why people invented cow tunnels. Or at least the story of cow tunnels.

    <itunes:summary>The westernmost part of Manhattan, between 34th and 39th street, is pretty industrial. There’s a bus depot, a ferry terminal, and a steady stream of cars. But in the late 19th early 20th centuries, this was cow country.
Cows used to be ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey, herded across Twelfth Avenue (now the West Side Highway), and brought to this part of town to be made into beef.
You’ve heard of the meat packing district. This was like the meat hacking district. It was nicknamed "Abattoir Place." It was a hive of bone boilers and hide stretchers and lard renderers. There was a disassembly line for every single part of a cow.
As more and more cows were ferried to the slaughterhouses in Manhattan, it became impossible for passing herds to to coexist with Twelfth Avenue traffic. Not only did the number of cows increase, but so too had the number of carriages, and trains, and, eventually, cars. Cows were in the way. There were reports of epic cow jams on Twelfth avenue.
That’s why people invented cow tunnels. Or at least the story of cow tunnels. At one point there might have actually been tunnels made expressly for cows to march underneath Twelfth Avenue to the abattoir. Or people might have just invented this crazy story about cow tunnels because everybody loves a good, vaguely plausible urban myth.
We have tunnels for cars, for subways, electrical cables, and the internet. Could there be subterranean infrastructure for cows, too?</itunes:summary>

The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is the nation&#8217;s only permanent underground repository for nuclear waste. Eventually, WIPP will be sealed up and left alone. Years will pass and those years will become decades. Those decades will become centuries and those centuries will roll into millennia. People above ground will come and go. Cultures will rise and fall. And all the while, below the surface, that cave full of waste will get smaller and smaller, until the salt caverns swallow up all those oil drums and entombs them. Then, all the old radioactive gloves and tools and little bits from bombs –all still radioactive– will be solidified in the earth&#8217;s crust for more than 200,000 years. Basically forever.<br />
The problem that the aforementioned panel was convened to address was how to convey this information to people 10,000 years in the future, when language and symbols may be so different as to make direct communication impossible.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About ten miles north of Concord, New Hampshire, off of interstate 93 there’s a little island with a great, big monument on it. The monument depicts a woman, who is holding a hatchet in her right hand and bunch of scalps in her left hand. When it was erected in 1874, this was the first statue to honor a woman in the United States. But despite this historic status, the monument is controversial because of the woman it memorializes and what she did. The woman in the monument is Hannah Duston and in 1697 she was living in Haverhill, Massachusetts when she, her infant daughter and her nurse-maid, Mary Neff were kidnapped by a band of Abenaki Native Americans. The three were marched north and at some point Hannah’s infant daughter was killed by the Abenakis. They stopped for the night in Boscawen, New Hampshire (on the island above with the monument) and while the Abenaki families slept, Hannah and her companions killed ten of them – including six children – and then scalped each victim before making their escape back to Haverhill.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uniforms matter. When it comes to sports, they might be the only thing to which we&#8217;re actually loyal.<br />
Sports uniforms are packaging. But unlike any other packaging, if the product inside changes or degrades, we remain loyal. Players come and go, but change the uniform, and you&#8217;ll hear about it.<br />
There are very few ways for players to put their own personal style into their uniforms. In baseball, in the face of huge opposition from curved-brim loyalists, some players take the bold stance of wearing a straight brim, like George Sherrill who is nick-named &#8220;The Brim Reaper&#8221; for his flat-brimmed style.<br />
But for people who really geek out about baseball uniforms (like Paul Lukas from Uni Watch) the space below the knee may be the most interesting. It is here that players have the most choices, can make the biggest statement, and be, in the words of Lukas, masters of the &#8220;uni-verse.&#8221;<br />
Most players today choose to wear their pants long, but if you truly want to honor baseball&#8217;s hosiery heritage, you should wear your pants up over your calves and a sharp pair of stirrups.</p>
<p>Paul Lukas of Uni Watch (and creator of the zine Beer Frame, to which 99% Invisible owes a considerable debt) talked with Jesse Thorn, host of the NPR show Bullseye, owner of Maximumfun.org, and life-long SF Giants fans, even though it&#8217;s really hard to wear the cap out because black and orange doesn&#8217;t go with anything.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The name is important. It’s the first thing of any product you use or buy or see. The tip of the spear. You are bombarded by thousands of names every day.<br />
In this daily barrage, only the names that are most interesting and most pleasant on the tongue can survive in your memory. So it&#8217;s no surprise that companies—especially large ones like Sony or Procter &amp; Gamble—hire naming companies.<br />
That is, there are companies that come up with names for things. Cars, lines of yogurt, iPhone apps, small businesses, sodas, movies, and even theories have all been named by professionals.<br />
There are really only a handful of businesses that deal exclusively in names, and their services can cost thens of thousands of dollars. In addition to coming up with names, they also determine what names are available for trademark, which URLs are available, and they conduct linguistic checks to ensure that potential names are pronounceable, unique, and appropriate in languages around the world.</p>

    <itunes:summary>The name is important. It’s the first thing of any product you use or buy or see. The tip of the spear. You are bombarded by thousands of names every day.
In this daily barrage, only the names that are most interesting and most pleasant on the tongue can survive in your memory. So it's no surprise that companies—especially large ones like Sony or Procter &amp; Gamble—hire naming companies.
That is, there are companies that come up with names for things. Cars, lines of yogurt, iPhone apps, small businesses, sodas, movies, and even theories have all been named by professionals.
There are really only a handful of businesses that deal exclusively in names, and their services can cost thens of thousands of dollars. In addition to coming up with names, they also determine what names are available for trademark, which URLs are available, and they conduct linguistic checks to ensure that potential names are pronounceable, unique, and appropriate in languages around the world.</itunes:summary>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a beauty to a universal standard. The idea that people across the world can agree that when they interact with one specific thing, everyone will be on the same page&#8211; regardless of language or culture or geographic locale. If you&#8217;re in Belgrade or Shanghai or São Paulo, you can look at a sign and know instantly, without speaking a word of the local language, that this floor is slippery. That the emergency exit is over there. That that substance is poisonous, and you should not eat it.</p>
<p>The group behind those internationally recognized logos is called the International Organization for Standardization. One of the most recognizable ISO symbols in the International Symbol of Access. You might not know it by that name, but you&#8217;ve seen it.</p>

    <itunes:summary>There is a beauty to a universal standard. The idea that people across the world can agree that when they interact with one specific thing, everyone will be on the same page-- regardless of language or culture or geographic locale. If you're in Belgrade or Shanghai or São Paulo, you can look at a sign and know instantly, without speaking a word of the local language, that this floor is slippery. That the emergency exit is over there. That that substance is poisonous, and you should not eat it.

The group behind those internationally recognized logos is called the International Organization for Standardization. One of the most recognizable ISO symbols in the International Symbol of Access. You might not know it by that name, but you've seen it.

They were business partners. Van Alen was considered the artistic maverick and Severance was the savvy businessman. It's unclear why they broke up, but at some point, Severance decided he could do better on his own. The two parted ways and set up separate practices.

At the time of their breakup, New York City was undergoing a boom like nothing ever seen before. Massive wealth turned Manhattan into some of the most valuable property in human history. And when property gets valuable, we build up.

Late in 1928 Walter Chrysler, founder of the Chrysler car company, came to New York and bought a plot of land and decided to build, what he referred to as, "a monument to me." Van Alen had already been working on plans for the previous owner of that plot and Chrysler decided to hire him to develop that plan into what would become the Chrysler Building. Walter Chrysler was a great fan of art and architecture and felt a real kinship with the Beaux-Arts trained William Van Alen.

Meanwhile, downtown at 40 Wall Street, Craig Severance was planning the Manhattan Company Building. It was funded primarily by the young, Wall Street hot shot, George Ohrstrom.

<p>Capt. William F. Smith, who had led some of the most dangerous missions in World War II in the European theatre, was the pilot. The day was foggy.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you tune around on a shortwave radio, you might stumble across a voice reciting an endless stream of numbers. Just numbers, all day, everyday.

<p>These mysterious shortwave transmissions caught the attention of producer David Goren when he was just a kid. His piece, Atencion! Seis Siete Tres Siete Cero: The Mystery of the Shortwave Numbers Stations, aired in 2000 as part of the series Lost and Found Sound. In tuning into these weird little broadcasts, Goren joins a curious community that has been listening to numbers stations for decades, some suspecting that the stations are run by intelligence agencies sending encrypted messages to individual agents in the field.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cameron Smith is building a space suit in his apartment.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not an astronaut. He&#8217;s not even an engineer. Cameron Smith is an archaeologist&#8211;on faculty in the anthropology department at Portland State University in Oregon. But Cameron is an explorer by nature. He’s been diving in Puget Sound, survived arctic winters in Iceland and Alaska and summited Oregon’s Mount Hood more times than he can count.</p>
<p>Now he wants to take on outer space. And since Cameron doesn&#8217;t have an entire space program behind him, that means doing it on the cheap. His homemade space suite costs $2,000. A standard issue suit from NASA runs about $12 million.</p>
<p>The space suit has been a 3 years in the making. Eventually, Cameron will put on the suit and step into a gondola and a balloon (also homemade) will take him up 50,000 feet in the air. At that point, he&#8217;ll be depending on his own craftiness to keep himself alive.</p>
<p>This episode is based off an episode of the public radio program and podcast, Destination DIY.</p>

The space suit has been a 3 years in the making. Eventually, Cameron will put on the suit and step into a gondola and a balloon (also homemade) will take him up 50,000 feet in the air. At that point, he'll be depending on his own craftiness to keep himself alive.

This episode is based off an episode of the public radio program and podcast, Destination DIY.</itunes:summary>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have one cardinal rule on 99% Invisible: No cardinals. Meaning, we deal with the built world, not the natural world.</p>
<p>So, when I read Jon Mooallem’s brilliant book, Wild Ones: A Sometimes Dismaying, Weirdly Reassuring Story About Looking at People Looking at Animals in America, I didn’t think we&#8217;d ever do an episode of 99% Invisible about it. I just read it for fun.</p>

<p>What you need to know about Wild Ones is that it&#8217;s not a book about nature. It’s a book about how we fit nature into our lives. Wild Ones is about the cutesy stuffed animals, the eco-tours, and the byzantine methods of conservation that evolve when our experience with wild life goes from something natural to something designed. Human-animal interaction has become a designed experience and the story of that transition, as the title of the book suggests, is sometimes dismaying and weirdly reassuring.</p>

What’s the difference between what the public sees and what an architect sees when they look at a building?

The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenues in Lincolnwood, Illinois used to be the town’s most famous building: The first Hyatt hotel in all of Chicagoland, premiere accommodations, top-notch restaurant. It was swank! Roberta Flack stayed there. Barry Mannilow stayed there. Perry Como. Michael Jordon stayed there on his first night in Chicago. Every thirteen-year-old in the area had their bar mitzvah there.

Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwood’s most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. It’s now dilapidated and empty.

But even if you know nothing about the history, everyone in the area knows this hotel.

Because it’s purple. Really, really purple.</itunes:summary>

<p>If you were a movie star in the market for a mansion in 1930s Los Angeles, there was a good chance you might call on Wallace Neff.</p>
<p>Neff wasn&#8217;t just an architect&#8211;he was a starchitect. One of his most famous projects was the renovation of Pickfair, the estate owned by the iconic silent film actress Mary Pickford, and her husband Douglas Fairbanks. When the couple moved into Pickfar, the house sat on a nameless street in an empty neighborhood called Beverly Hills. If you were lucky enough to be invited to dinner at Pickfair you might find yourself seated next to Babe Ruth, the King of Spain or Albert Einstein. Life magazine called Pickfair “only slightly less important than the white house, and much more fun.” Neff designed estates for Charlie Chaplin, Judy Garland and Groucho Marx. His Libby Ranch is now owned by Reese Witherspoon.</p>
<p>But at the end of his life, Wallace Neff lived in a 1,000 square foot concrete bubble. And Neff believed that this simple dome was his greatest architectural achievements.</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based reporter David Weinberg spoke with historian Jeffrey Head, author of No Nails, No Lumber: The Bubble Houses of Wallace Neff. David also spoke with Kathy Miles, who grew up in Igloo Village; Steve Roden, an artist and current resident of the last remaining bubble house in the US; and architect Stefanos Polyzoides, who has his practice in a classic Spanish/Mediterranean-style Wallace Neff building.</p>
<p>We also hear from Dakar-based producer Juliana Friend, who was nice enough to go check on the bubbles over there.</p>
<p>A different version of this story originally aired on KCRW as part of their Independent Producer Project.</p>
<p>David Weinberg is also the brains behind Random Tape, an audio experiment in, well, random tape.</p>

To find Heyoon, you'd drive out into the middle of nowhere, deep in the country, and park alongside a dirt road. A fence ran along the property line, with signage explicitly telling passers by to keep out.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers have an ethics code. Journalists have an ethics code. Architects do, too. According to Ethical Standard 1.4 of the American Institute of Architects (AIA):</p>
<p>&#8220;Members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group called Architects, Designers, and Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has taken the stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built. Buildings that, by design, violate standards of human rights.</p>
<p>Specifically, this refers to prisons with execution chambers, or prisons that are designed keep people in long-term isolation (or as prison officials call it, &#8220;segregation&#8221;). The latter kind of prison is called a &#8220;supermax,&#8221; or &#8220;security housing unit&#8221; (SHU). There is no legal definition for solitary confinement, so it&#8217;s up for debate as to whether the SHU constitutes solitary confinement.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of controversy surrounding one SHU at a Northern California prison called Pelican Bay.</p>
<p>Life inside of the SHU at Pelican Bay means 22 to 23 hours a day inside of 7.5 by 12 foot room. It&#8217;s not a space that&#8217;s designed to keep you comfortable. But it&#8217;s not just these architectural features, that concern humanitarian activists and psychiatrists. It&#8217;s the amount of time many prisoners spend in that cells, alone, without any meaningful activity. Some psychiatrists, such as Terry Kupers, say there is a whole litany of effects that a SHU can have on a person: massive anxiety, paranoia, depression, concentration and memory problems, and loss of ability to control one&#8217;s anger (which can get a prisoner in trouble and lengthen the SHU sentence). In California, SHU inmates are 33 times more likely to commit suicide than other prisoners incarcerated elsewhere in the state. There are even reports of eye damage due to the restriction on distance viewing. Terry Kupers says that a SHU &#8220;destroys people as human beings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Compared with some other prisons in the California system, the Pelican Bay SHU has some redeeming architectural features. Inmates can get natural light from skylights outside of their cells, which drifts in through doors made of a perforated metal. These porous doors also allow for inmates to communicate with each other, even though there are no lines of sight to any prisoner from within the cell.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, cells don&#8217;t have windows. Inmates never get to see the horizon. The only times prisoners get to leave the cell is to visit the shower, or the exercise yard&#8211;which is an empty, windowless room not that much bigger than a cell, with twenty-foot high concrete walls.</p>
<p>Again, there is no universally accepted definition of solitary confinement. But some groups, like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have gone beyond calling the SHU solitary confinement&#8211;they call it torture. In 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture said anything over 15 days in solitary confinement is a human rights abuse&#8211;which other sources have interpreted as torture.<br />
So if it is the ethical code of architects to promote human rights&#8230;what is their responsibility to the people who are incarcerated in their buildings?</p>
<p>Enter Raphael Sperry, a San Francisco-based architect and president of ADPSR. He believes it&#8217;s up to architects to lead the charge against these buildings. Sperry and the ADPSR are trying to get the American Institute of Architects to adopt an amendment to their ethics code:</p>
<p>&#8220;Members shall not design spaces intended for execution or for torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, including prolonged solitary confinement.&#8221;</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the ancient Greeks, sirens were mythical creatures who sang out to passing sailors from rocks in the sea. Their music was so beautiful, it was said, that the sailors were powerless against it&#8211;they would turn their ships towards these sea nymphs and crash in the impassable reefs around them.</p>
<p>In Homer&#8217;s Odyssey, there&#8217;s a story where Odysseus and his men are traveling near an area that Sirens are known to inhabit. Odysseus knows that if he hears the siren&#8217;s song, his ship is going to sink. But he still wants to hear what they sound like. So he comes up with a plan: Odysseus has his men tie him to the mast of his ship so that he can&#8217;t give commands. And then Odysseus has his men fill their own ears with beeswax so they can&#8217;t hear anything. They set sail in striking distance of the sirens&#8217; call. The plan works: Odysseus gets to hear the music, his men don&#8217;t, and they sail on to safety&#8211;with Odysseus pleading with his crew to crash the boat the whole way.</p>
<p>And for the next 2000 or so years, that&#8217;s what a siren was: a creature that makes a beautiful sound.</p>
<p>But that all changed in 1819, when a French engineer named Charles Cagniard de la Tour decided to call the artificial noisemaker he was working on&#8211;the siren.</p>
<p>And this new, mechanical siren became one of THE signature sounds of the turn of the Century. Sirens warned people about immanent bombing raids during World War I. Sirens announced incoming fire engines, and ambulances, and police.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to the siren, the world of the the early 20th Century had become a lot louder than any time in human history. And we can probably assume that these sirens that people heard in cities all over the world&#8211;sounded NOTHING like the siren songs of Greek myth.</p>
<p>At least to most. One man, a composer, named Arseny Avraamov heard music in the cacophony of the modern world. And he tried to create a composition&#8211;a symphony&#8211; from the clatter of the newly formed Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Moscow-based producer Charles Maynes investigated the legend of Avraamov and his forgotten masterpiece. This is The Symphony of Sirens, Revisited.</p>
<p>This story was part of the Global Story Project, presented by PRX with support from the Open Society Foundations.</p>
<p>Plus, we hear a rebroadcast of &#8220;The Unsung Icons of Soviet Design.&#8221; (episode #25)</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where the fruit logos come from. In fact, in the UK, slot machines are called &#8220;fruit machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite outward appearances, slot machines have evolved dramatically since they first appeared in 1895.</p>
<p>To play the first slot machines, you slipped in a coin and pulled the lever to set the machine&#8217;s wheels in motion. The slot machine&#8217;s crank-action operation (and the way it took your money) earned it the nickname of the &#8220;one-armed bandit.&#8221;</p>
<p>But today, those hand-crank levers are uncommon, and where they do exist they are known as &#8220;legacy levers,&#8221; because they have zero relation to how the machine actually works. Everything inside a slot machine has been computerized and automated&#8211;from how you enter money, to how you bet, to how you play, to how you win and lose, and even to how you feel when leave.</p>
<p>At first, gambling machines existed at the fringes of casino culture&#8211;both figuratively and literally.

<p>But then video technology expanded what slots could do. Now a machine could have more rows and columns than the standard three-by-three, and allowed you to place multiple bets on a single spin.

    <itunes:summary>Americans have always had an uneasy relationship with gambling. To circumvent anti-gambling laws in the US, early slot machines masqueraded as vending machines. They gave out chewing gum as prizes, and those prizes could be redeemed for cash.

That's where the fruit logos come from. In fact, in the UK, slot machines are called "fruit machines."

Despite outward appearances, slot machines have evolved dramatically since they first appeared in 1895.

To play the first slot machines, you slipped in a coin and pulled the lever to set the machine's wheels in motion. The slot machine's crank-action operation (and the way it took your money) earned it the nickname of the "one-armed bandit."

But today, those hand-crank levers are uncommon, and where they do exist they are known as "legacy levers," because they have zero relation to how the machine actually works. Everything inside a slot machine has been computerized and automated--from how you enter money, to how you bet, to how you play, to how you win and lose, and even to how you feel when leave.

At first, gambling machines existed at the fringes of casino culture--both figuratively and literally. The real money was in tabletop games--or so it was thought--and the slots were set up around the edges of the casino to give gamblers' wives something to do while they waited.

But then video technology expanded what slots could do. Now a machine could have more rows and columns than the standard three-by-three, and allowed you to place multiple bets on a single spin. A penny slot machine could let you place a hundred different one-cent bets per spin--so even if you win 40 cents on one line, and the machine congratulates you with flashing lights and chimes, you still lose 60 cents.

And that's how video slots have become the most lucrative--and addictive--game in a casino.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of how you feel about basketball, you’ve got to appreciate the way it can bring groups of strangers together to share moments of pure adulation and collective defeat.</p>
<p>That moment when time is running out, the team is down by one, a player arcs the ball from downtown just as the buzzer sounds—and sinks it. It’s exhilarating. It’s heart breaking. And most of all, it’s good design. But it’s not the way basketball was originally designed.</p>
<p>During pro basketball’s infancy in the 1950s, nothing forced a player to shoot the ball. If a team was winning, and they wanted to keep their lead, the team could literally hold on to the ball for ten minutes and run the clock out.</p>
<p>But in 1954, Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone had crunched some numbers, and he believed that some simple arithmetic could save basketball.</p>
<p>Reporter Eric Mennel, from the radio show BackStory with the American History Guys, spoke with Dolph Schayes—who played on the Syracuse Nationals both before and after the advent of the shot clock—about how Biasone’s contribution to the game shaped basketball into what it has become today.</p>

<p>This is how it worked: A developer bought an old house, tore it down, and had an architect draw up plans for a high rise. And then Rodrigo stepped in to give the building a name.

You&#8217;ve never heard of it, he explained, because the Zanzibar never sank.</p>

Walking through this historic district, it’s just like any other quaint European city. There are tourist shops, horse-drawn carriage rides, church spires. The buildings are beautiful--but they are not original.
During World War II, Nazi forces razed more than 80% of Warsaw. After Soviet troops took over, much of the city was rebuilt in the with communist style: fast, cheap, and big. They built apartment blocks, wide avenues, and heavy grey buildings. It was communist ideology in architectural form.
But when it came to the historic district of Warsaw-- the Old Town and a long connecting section called the Royal Route--they decided not just to rebuild, but to restore. Builders would use the same stones, and use special kilns to make special bricks to preserve its authenticity. After six years of reconstruction, the new Old Town was opened. Poles were ecstatic to have it back. Even in the West, it was seen as a triumph of the human spirit.
But here's the thing: Warsaw’s historic Old Town is not a replica of the original. It’s a re-imagining. An historic city that never really was.
Reporters and producers Amy Drozdowska and Dave McGuire talk with social anthropologist Michael Murawski about the fake recreation of Old Town and what it means to modern Warsaw.</itunes:summary>
